                <p>With Apple CarPlay and Android Auto systems from RadioMasters you can safely use the capabilities of Apple and Android while driving a car</p>
                <h2>What is Apple CarPlay and Android Auto</h2>
                <p>Apple CarPlay was released in 2014 and Android Auto in 2015. Both systems display basic smartphone functions on the car’s multimedia screen.</p>

In addition, having a smart system is significantly different from connecting an analog phone to a car – in fact, you fully control your smartphone using the buttons on the steering wheel, without being distracted from the road.</p>
                <p>A multimedia system with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto is an excellent opportunity to quickly synchronise your smartphone with the car. This way you can either leave your phone in the holder or put it away so you don’t have to be distracted from the road.</p>
